Installing bc-letters
=====================

bc-letters is currently only available on github. To install it and its submodules,
run the following commands at a shell prompt:

 git clone git@github.com:cliotropic/bc-letters.git
 git submodule init
 git submodule update
 rake gems:install     # to install some dependencies

Now, set up config/database.yml with information about where you'd like to store
the data. (See the Rails documentation if you need to know how to do this. The
data that's there by default works on my own machine.)
 
 rake db:migrate       # set up database
 script/server         # start the server

You can play with the application by loading http://localhost:3000/ in a web browser.
You won't see much until you import your own images.

Importing images
================

If you want to import your own images into the database, first read lib/tasks/bc-letters_tasks.rake so that you understand the file setup
the box importer is looking for. You'll need to set $BASEPATH according to the
instructions found there. Then, to import the image information and file the images:
 
 rake bcletters:import:boxpath
