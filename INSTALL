 git submodule init
 git submodule update
 rake gems:install     # to install some dependencies
 rake db:migrate       # set up database

Importing images

First, read lib/tasks/bc-letters_tasks.rake so that you understand the file setup
the box importer is looking for. You'll need to set $BASEPATH according to the
