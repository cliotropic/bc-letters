TODO for BC-letters
===================

- More documentation.

- Read documentfiles information in from a base path:
    Build an importer that slurps in metadata about files and links to originals. It could start 
    in a folder directory or higher up, but it should be capable of doing a recursive walk of a 
    collection down from the Series level, at least.
	ETA: start at the Box level, perhaps.

- Group unassigned images to create letters.

- Placename support

- Mapping places

- Place mapping at particular times with Simile widget.
   
- Make item pages export Zotero information for citation
    The idea here is that this application should prototype what information is necessary to keep
    in a personal research database that'll interface with one's citation database; 
    interoperability, rather than data silos.
   
- Give letters the ability to know their own pages in order
	This would enable all the pages of a letter to be shown as thumbnails and then clicked on for
	a zoom view.
	
- Create wrapper methods in Letter for DocumentFiles transcriptions, lined up.

- Consider using Paperclip for attachments instead of attachment_fu
