TODO for BC-letters
===================

- More documentation.

- A formal test suite.

- Group unassigned images to create letters.

- Placename support

- Mapping places

- Place mapping at particular times with Simile widget.
   
- Make item pages export Zotero information for citation
    The idea here is that the application should keep specialized information that
    goes beyond what I can keep in Zotero, but it should be easy to cite the original source document from a Letter page, using COiNS metadata.
   
- Give letters the ability to know their own pages in order
    This would enable all the pages of a letter to be shown as thumbnails and then clicked on for a zoom view.
	
- Create wrapper methods in Letter for DocumentFiles transcriptions, lined up.
